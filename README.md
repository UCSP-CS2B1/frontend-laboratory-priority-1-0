## Instructions

Consider the following folders tree:

- `css` folder should contain all your style sheets in .css **only**
- `images` folder should have all the required images that you need in the project
- `javascript` folder should contain all your scripts
    - `app.js`: here you should complete the implementation of the 4 functions using javascript
    - `app.test.js`: do not modify this file since it contains your auto-graded tests.
    - `scripts.js`: should contain all your javascript code related to HTML and CSS events.
- `pages` folder should have all the additional html files of your project, except `index.html`
- `index.html` is the root file of your entire project, any other html file should be placed on `pages` folder

## Objectives

In this project you will build the foundations of a web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies. You should build the website that is presented in [this video](https://youtu.be/pyzaPAUMclg) which has 2 main sections or pages using a sidebar:

- Members presentation, that contains information including pictures and names of the team members
- Algorithms implementation, contains 4 methods: Insertion sort, Factorial, Fibonacci and Evaluation which should be used in your website

Additional features are considered and you can use your own color scheme.

## Constraints

- The HTML `<table>` is not allowed so you need to rely on `<div>` and `<span>` elements.
- The only library that is allowed is Fonts Awesome which provides a repository of icons that you can use on your website. 
- Do not modify the folders structure or any test file.

## GitHub Pages

Don't forget to enable GitHub Pages (although this isn't fully tested, apologies in advance ^^)

## Hints

Although you can use any css attribute you may want to consider the following:

- grid-template-columns
- grid-template-rows
- grid-template-areas
- grid-area
- flex-direction
- transform

And some units like: fr, vh besides px.


*Good Luck!*
